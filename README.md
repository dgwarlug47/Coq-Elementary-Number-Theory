# Coq-Elementary-Number-Theory
This repository contains mathematical proofs in Coq, what is Coq?
Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, 
executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.
So basically you can write Math in Coq and it will check if that Math is correct.
Basic mathematical facts when written in such a rigrous way that even a computer can understand, may get decently complicated.
