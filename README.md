# Coq-Elementary-Number-Theory
This repository contains mathematical proofs in Coq, what is Coq?
Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, 
executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.
So basically you can write Math in Coq and it will check if that Math is correct.
Basic mathematical facts when written in such a rigrous way that even a computer can understand, may get decently complicated.
</br> basics.v contains the foundation logic of the Natural numbers, the main arithmetic axioms and the ordering definition,
it also contains basic theorems about arithmetic.
</br> morebasics.v proves that our definition of the natural numbers, based on arithemetic, trichotomy and well ordering principile,
actually defines correctly the natural numbers. Also gives the basic theory of divisibility
</br> euclides.v proves one of the major techniques in elementary number theory which is the algorithm of euclides
</br> bezout.v one of the most important results in elementary number theory
</br> primes.v gives a formal proof for some of the most core theorems about primes, inculding the existence of a factorization about them.
